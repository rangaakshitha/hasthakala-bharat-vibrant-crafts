        description: 'Blue Pottery is a unique Jaipur craft known for its vibrant cobalt blue glaze and intricate floral designs. Made without clay, it blends Persian art with Indian tradition.',
        history: "The history of the art of pottery is as old as the history of mankind. Glass was discovered in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Syria, Iran and Indus Valley. It was further discovered that when alkaline soil was mixed with copper and heated it gave a turquoise blue color. From Mohenjodaro and Harappan era right till the Gupta period glazed utensils, necklaces, beads and tiles were in vogue. This art greatly flourished during the Buddhist period. The Central Asian and Middle Eastern glazing techniques came to India with the several successive Islamic invasions while the Chinese porcelain continued to be imported to the Indian courts (both pre-Mughal and Mughal). The Baburnama, commissioned in 1590 in the reign of Akbar mentions that ‚ÄúBabur and his friends were regularly served kebabs and pilaus from dishes and plates that are sometimes golden, sometimes green and sometimes blue and white.-¬ù The miniatures paintings of the era also depict the same. Researches of the Archaeological Survey of India mentions the fact that the glazed tiles first appear in Delhi in the Tughlaq monuments dated between 1321 AD and 1414 AD. The designs of which are inspired from the Turkish patterns. Excavations at the Purana Qila have revealed glazed ware of the Sultanate period from 1206 to 1526. The pottery introduced to India in Delhi and Multan is believed to have come from Bokhara. Some of the earliest tile work can also be seen in Arab-ki-Sarai in Delhi near Humayuns tomb. The other centres of glazing and painting tiles opened up at Khurja, Agra, Meerut, Rampur, Bulandshahar due to the mushrooming of glazing kilns. When the city of Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh I, craftsmen from all over the country were invited to come and make their home in this new city. Royal patronage, lucrative offers and the attraction of living in a beautiful city led many artisans and craftsmen to come and settle in Jaipur. By the beginning of the 19th century the city was well established as a thriving art centre. In keeping with the traditions of his forefathers, Sawai Ram Singh II (1835-1880) set up a school of art and continued to encourage artists and craftsmen. Blue Pottery took an interesting route in finding its home in Jaipur. Ram Singh II attended a kite flying session and watched as his kite masters were engaged in battle with two brothers from Achnera (near Agra). When the ruler saw that the brothers managed to bring down the royal kites almost every time, he was intrigued. He asked the brothers their secret. They told him that they were potters by profession and had coated their strings with the same blue green glass that they used for their pots. Sawai Ram Singh II was impressed so he invited the brothers to stay in Jaipur and teach this unique form of glazed pottery at his new art school. On the Verge of Extinction Blue Pottery had enormous potential and should have flourished, but over the years master potters refused to share their trade secrets with their fellow craftsmen so there was an eventual lowering of standards and a gradual dying out of the craft. Over the years the craft was kept alive by her Highness Gayatri Devi who widely promoted Blue Pottery. The craft received a much needed boost in the 1960s as internationally renowned artist; Kripal Singh Shekhawat entered the field of Blue Pottery and raised the bar. His presence brought a new excitement to the craft as his designs began selling very well.",

Most of the material melts, but 80 per cent of the quartz is left behind, and this maintains the form of the vessel. The kiln is left to cool for three days, avoiding any rapid temperature change which cracks the china very easily. Care is taken that no two vessels touch each other as they may turn black. After cooling, the vessels are taken out and are ready for sale.'
